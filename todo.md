### TO DO Tests for Rust developer

Rust small test
1)download and Install 
https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/quick-start

2)
do a screen recording and run hello world
https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/hello_world
and 
do a screen recording of this
https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/examples/liquidity-pool

Upload both of these to github

For the remainder of the 5 hours look at these questions
3) Could we modify the liquidity pool to look like curv.fi? with a flatter curve?
4) What would it take to do this?

5)What would a lending market look like on Soroban? Could we take Aave or an equivalent of something available on Solana?

6) with https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/examples/cross-contract-call could we build a bridge to solana?


Thanks!
